# libraryandframwork
In software development, the terms "library" and "framework" refer to different concepts, although they share some similarities

Library and framework
Both framework and libraries are code written by someone that is used to help solve common problem.
Why use library and framework
This use for reusability
The purpose is to help solve common problem in easier way.
Library
This is essentially a set of function that user can call. Each call does some work and return control to the client.
Framwork
This is embodies some abstract design with more behaviour built in. Because a framework is itself an application, it has a wider scope and includes almost everything necessary to make a user application as per his own needs. Wikipedia makes it more clear.
"In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software"
Inversion of control
The technical difference between framework and library in a term called inversion of control.
When user use the library , you are in charge of the flow of the application. User choosing when and where to call the library.
When user use the framework the in charge is the itself. It provide some place for you to plug in your code , but it call the code you plug in as needed.
